          <p class="card-text">My group and I have been planning and listing down the resources, equipment (scanners and tags) as well as our backend development plan (MSSQL, MYSQL, C#, Python, Javascript, etc) that we intend to use for this project. We are also discussing how we can each contribute to this project with our various strengths in order to streamline our work and maximise efficiency.</p>
          <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-body-secondary">Contributions</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I contributed some of my ideas by using an RFID system (with a unique RFID tag tagged with their nametags) in order to keep track of employees work attendance. With a RFID sensor to tag each employee that enters and exits the compound. This will track what time they enter and exit the compound without additional actions such as (e.g. tapping their employee cards to clock in)</p>

          <p class="card-text"> This week, we drew up a rough sketch of our idea which includes the different compoents, software (Tableau, SQL, etc.), hardware (rfid reader, speakers, cameras, etc.) as well as other items 
            we would be including in our project. This sketch combines all our ideas together on what we find plausible and finalises our project map moving forward. We also completed a list of items which we would require from our sponsors. With this, we are also trying to split up our roles to be in charge of different areas prefably roles 
            that we are comfortable with and stronger in.

            My group and I have come together to do up the Inception Deck which helps us align our thoughts and sets our team expections
            to ensure that everyone is on the right track. As seen above, we have completed the NOT list which puts the stakes in the ground and sets expectations  
            around what we are going to be doing for this project. We have also finalised our pitch as well as our project name and logo which presents our brand to our audience.
            Our group agreed on the name Project SmoothStart as we all agree that it sounds meaningful and aligned with our motto and goals.

          <p class="card-text">This week, my group and I have managed to dive into deeper detail of our project. Firstly, we have split our roles, and we now have a clear understanding of the tasks that each of us are in charge of. 
            As seen on the image above, I will be in charge of the security of the Database, controlling the users added, and who has permission to view and access the database. I will also be helping out with creating and specing the 
            database to fit our needs. The other image shows the structure of the database that we have drawn out which includes the various attributes as well as the foreign keys that need to be created.
          </p>
          <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-body-secondary">Contributions</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I helped my team start on the database stucture and plan out future modifications that we might need to create. We also sat down to discuss what are the various tasks that we need to complete and tasks that we can complete before our hardware arrives.
            In line with our SDD module, we have also set up our scrum team and decided on our roles. Moving on, we will be going through the Team development stages, improving and performing together as a team.

          <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-body-secondary">OAL</h5>
          <p class="card-text">This week for OAL I went through the 4 videos to gain a better understanding of the Aglie Methododology, comparison between the waterfall model, how agile products are developed and the aim of this Methododology. 
            Additionally the video on scrum help me to strengthen my understanding of the scrum framework, roles artifacts and the ceremonies involved which I had learnt in the SDD module. Finally, I learnt how to use the Trello board for agile sprints, features, its integrations and best practices which we can consider utilising for our project to help streamline the flow with the Scrum framework.

          <p class="card-text">As a team, this week we have done our first draft of the Text-To-Speech code which my groupmates are currently testing and refining as shown above. My groupmate and I are also working on the SQL statements which we would be using. Next week, we will be finalising the database and running test data which will test the functionality of our database and allow us to 
            fix any shortcomings or problems which might arise. Finally, we have discussed the structure of the gantry system, where the various equipment would be placed and how we intend to integrate them together to function cohesively.

          <p class="card-text">This week, I helped my team to develop the SQL code for the project as shown on the image above, through some discussion, we were also able to finalise on our final plans for our database which included 3 tables,
            the record, employee and shift tables. We also identified the various constraints for the different attributes in order for our code to align with the sql. Additionally, we also discussed our plans for the upcoming Hackathon and how we were going to
            develop our ideas and plans moving forward. As part of my role, I will also be working on the security aspect of the database, creating various roles and users which have different access restrictions. (E.g. A data analyst will only be able to view the data and 
            not the SQL structure of the database)

          <p class="card-text">This week, we participated in the ByteHackz Hackathon where we spent a grueling 2.5 days coding and collaborating to produce a product prototype for our sponsor, AIDC. For our prototype, we were able to produce a working RFID reader which included facial recognition that is connected to the Pi. Using an internal database in the Pi, we were able to add staff data that contained our unique RFID key, and facial recognition which the device was trained on 
            earlier. With this data, once we tapped our RFID card, and the facial recognition device was able to recognise our faces, the speaker module was able to read out the staff data to signify that a record was added to the system. Finally, we presented our product to the stakeholder. Through the feedback, we have taken into consideration some improvements that are to be made in the future and we will work towards implementing a improved version of our product for our final submission.
            Through this experience I have found that our weakness is not being unable to deliver the product but having problems trying to present our work/product we are slightly unorgranised, unclear and there was also lacking information, this can be a problem in the future where we might have a revolutionary product but being unable to sell our product to clients can pose a threat. Thus, for our final presentation I have made it our goal to work on our presentation skills in order to 
            present our product well to the client and convince them why they should believe in us.

          <p class="card-text">During the span of the 2.5 days, I managed to finalise my SQL database which involved many tweaks to ensure that the data could be written to and retrieved reliably. Additionally, I generated around 50 instances of test data for the SQL database to test and run and ensure the foreign keys and primary keys were properly assigned. Aside from the database,
            my groupmate and I also worked on a python console app which was intended to be the future interface for adding new staff and shifts into the database. Using this console app, we are able to add new staff, remove staff, add new shifts and remove shifts from the database. I had tried my best to ensure that our database is close to perfect and the different tables are relevant yet functional and the user will not run into any error while using the product as the database is the backbone of our
            product/application. I had also spent some time helping out with creating the slides for the presentation and figuring out the sequence of our presentation. Finally, I presented the SQL database that I had created and also present some of the Python Console App that my groupmate and I had worked on.
          </p>
          <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-body-secondary">Future Plans</h5>
          <p class="card-text">For our future plans, we are trying to make the RFID reader system more reliable, while ensuring it is fully connected to the future application and improved database. In the upcoming weeks, I will be working on our application that will be developed using C# ASP.NET Core and I will try to ensure that we can provide a good UI that will meet the client's standards
            and expectations. Once everything is pieced together, we should have our final product and most importantly, I will be trying to make sure that we can all improve on our presentation skills to show our product to the client and our lecturer.

            Over the past few weeks, my group and I have started development of our web application which is an advancement over our Python Console App done in Week 5. As a group we have chosen to proceed with the development of our application using ASP.NET Core as it was covered in WEB module in the previous semester and we have experience with developing such an application. For this application we are focusing on User Experience in order to make our web application user friendly. Some of the key features
            include a user login, home page, View (Search) for employee record, Update Staff, Remove Staff and Create New Staff. This application will be completed over the span of the next few weeks till our presentation and final presentation. Over the past few weeks, my groupmates have also helped to port the database I had created over to MySQL which we intend to use for our final submission.

            Over the past few weeks I have started working on the login page, building a user friendly login page that also looks attrative to the user. As of this week, I have completed the login page with the login function working. However, I am using a hard coded username and password to login instead of retrieval of the details from the database. This will be implemented in the next week and will be updated accordingly. The login function also includes password hashing that will help to protect the password as it will not be visible to 
            anyone who manages the database directly. The home page has been set up, however the functions and the design of the page will be done over the next few weeks.          </p>
